# API CRUD
This project has been initialized using Node.js. It's a JavaScript environment that allows us to develop the back-end part of our app. You can initialize your own by executing this command: `npm init`. 
This project is centered around the purpose of handling a data system for the medical laboratory (GSB) from the following
projects: GSB-mobile and GSB-web.

Currently, here you can see the valid routes provided by this CRUD API:

   + **Public routes**
   
    - **/api/clients** <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">[GET]</span>
    - **/api/clients/:id** <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">[GET]</span>
    - **/api/clients/:id** <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">[GET]</span>

   + **Admin routes**
    

> [!CAUTION]
> Some of the routes may not work properly because the mount is not completely over yet.
